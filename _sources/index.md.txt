## Overview

`airflow-common` provides common operators, topology helpers, and library management tasks for Apache Airflow workflows.

Key features:

- **Common Operators**: Convenience operators like `Skip`, `Fail`, and `Pass` for workflow control
- **Topology Helpers**: Functions like `all_success_any_failure` and `if_booted_do` for building complex DAG topologies
- **Library Management**: Pydantic models for `PipLibrary`, `CondaLibrary`, and `GitRepo` with corresponding operators for package installation
- **Infrastructure Tasks**: Operators for system maintenance like `JournalctlClean`

> [!NOTE]
> This library is built on [airflow-pydantic](https://github.com/airflow-laminar/airflow-pydantic) for Pydantic-based Airflow constructs, and integrates seamlessly with [airflow-config](https://github.com/airflow-laminar/airflow-config) for YAML-driven DAG definitions using Hydra.

## Installation

You can install from pip:

```bash
